* central tendency: A characteristic of a sample or population; intuitively, it is the most average value.
* spread: A characteristic of a sample or population; intuitively, it describes how much variability there is.
* variance: A summary statistic often used to quantify spread.
* standard deviation: The square root of variance, also used as a measure of spread.
* frequency: The number of times a value appears in a sample. histogram: A mapping from values to frequencies, or a graph that shows
 this mapping.
* probability: A frequency expressed as a fraction of the sample size. normalization: The process of dividing a frequency by a sample size to get a probability.
* distribution: A summary of the values that appear in a sample and the frequency, or probability, of each.
* PMF: Probability mass function: a representation of a distribution as a function that maps from values to probabilities.
* mode: The most frequent value in a sample.
* outlier: A value far from the central tendency.
* trim: To remove outliers from a dataset.
* bin: A range used to group nearby values.
* relative risk: A ratio of two probabilities, often used to measure a difference between distributions.
* conditional probability: A probability computed under the assumption that some condition holds.
* clinically significant: A result, like a difference between groups, that is relevant
 in practice
* Percentile rank: The percentage of values in a distribution that are less than or equal to a given value.
* CDF: Cumulative distribution function, a function that maps from values to their percentile ranks.
* Percentile: The value associated with a given percentile rank.
* Conditional distribution: A distribution computed under the assumption that some condition holds.
* Resampling: The process of generating a random sample from a distribution that was computed from a sample.
* Replacement: During a sampling process, “replacement” indicates that the population is the same for every sample. “Without replacement” indicates that each element can be selected only once.
* Interquartile range: A measure of spread, the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.
